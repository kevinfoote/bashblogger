 Installation 
 ------------ 
 There's directions on how to install bblog and get it running in the
 INSTALL file.  Go read that, the rest of this is just drivel anyway.
 
 Items of note
 -------------
 The Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) that controls the overall appearance
 of your site must be edited through an option in the bblog program.
 Bash Blogger will overwrite hand edited CSS files as the CSS are now
 considered as part of a theme.

 Bash Blogger themes are included as part of this tarball, 

 If you have a theme you've created and would like to share with the
 community, please consult the packaging directions at:

	http://bashblogger.grimthing.com/theme_submission_guidelines/

 If you're not familiar with editing CSS, there is an excellent
 reference located at:
		   
	http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_reference.asp

 The default favicon can be substituted with your own.  If you don't
 have a favicon, there's an online favicon generator located at:

 Using bblog
 -----------
 Bash Blogger now has an upgrade path.  You can now Import/Export 
 your entire site via one big honkin' RSS feed.  The RSS Import
 function has been tested with Wordpress RSS feeds and 
 Bash Blogger's own RSS feed, ymmv.
 
 Also, there is now an update script, (contributed by Doug Hunley),
 but it's not quite working this release.

 Bash Blogger also has command-line support. `bblog -h' will give
 a listing of all the available options.

 The default operation is fairly straightforward (to me).  If you
 don't think so, please email me with any suggestions or areas of
 improvement at:

	grim@grimthing.com

 Include "bashblogger" (one word) somewhere in the subject line. 
 This is important becase I have my spam filters wound a little
 too tight and your email missive might not reach my inbox 
 otherwise.  Thanks in advance for that.


 Wiki
 -----------
 I've decided to repurpose the wiki for documentation on how to use
 bashblogger.  That was my decision about a month ago and dangit
 that's what I'm going to do with it.

 Eventually. :)


 Description 
 ----------- 
 bblog uses bash, vi, ls, cat, sed, head, tail, mv, cp, rm and mkdir
 pushd, popd, curl and wc. The installer uses gnu tar and gzip, as 
 well as, rm, install, sort, cut, tr, md5sum, touch, wc, head and 
 tail.
 
 These programs are standard on most Linux installations, so I am
 confident that you will be able to use bblog as soon as you get
 through reading this boring commentary.  I  assure you that reading
 this passage cannot possibly be more boring than writing it.

 bblog was inspired by Bowie J. Poag's microblogger (mb) project.
 Whereas Bowie designed mb to use Server Side Includes(SSI) I wanted
 bblog to generate static XHTML that could be used on any webserver
 without the lengthy configuration of Apache, primarily because I'm
 lazy.

 bblog uses vi because it's fast over a network connection (which is
 how I usually update my journal), it's very powerful, comes standard
 on most *NIX installations and primarily because I'm a vi biggot.  
 However, the editor can be changed in the config file bblog.conf, 
 if you just _have_ to use pico, jed, nano, emacs, kate, gnotepad,
 nedit, etc.
 
 A token effort has been made towards making bashblogger portable.  
 If your system runs the bash shell, you should be good to go. I work
 on bashblogger on a Debian Etch box, the bashblogger site is run on
 a FreeBSD box, and I test it every once in a while on Max OS X (Tiger).

 It seems to run well everywhere I test it. ymmv.
