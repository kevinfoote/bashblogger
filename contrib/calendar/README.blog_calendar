This little script will create a calendar that has links to
the days where you made blog posts. If you didn't post on
a given day, there will be no link for that day.

You can see a working example of this at:
http://doug.hunley.homeip.net/

To use:
1) Create a new link box on your blog, called Calendar
2) adjust the script as needed to match your install
3) add the script to your daily crontab
4) Enjoy
