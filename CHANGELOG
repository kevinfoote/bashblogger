CHANGELOG
------------

October 25, 2007 bblog-0.3.7
* Removed annoying startup draft reminder.  Added draft count to
  main menu instead.
* Removed blogrolling.com code.  blogrolling.com code can easily be
  added via user sidebox
* Fixed line 543 bad substitution error and suppressed more
  instances of Pages.lnk and Pages2.lnk error
* Added unsupported user scripts to tarball under contrib/.
  Currently contains last.fm, netflix and calendar scripts
  contributed by Doug Hunley.  Check README.contrib for more info.
* Fixed the foo bug. The menubanner function created a file 'foo',
  used to generate the interactive menu banners. File will now be
  written to $CONF_DIR.  (Sorry again, Doug)
* importRSS should now be working.  Removed \/ from a sed expression
  and imported Doug's RSS feed locally.
* Added man page. it's rough, but it's usable.
* Removed CONFIG_DIR.tar.gz and added configdir w/ it's contents.
  adjusted bblog_setup accordingly
* Removed ROOTDIR.tar.gz and created rootdir/ with it's contents.
  Modified bblog_setup to reflect this
* Reworked toplevelarchives() and monthlyarchives().  Added
  dailyarchives().
* Updated several templates and added two directories and a file to
  $ARCHIVES.
* Added code to create lockfile, remove it on exit, warn if its
  there on startup
* Made installation of favicon.ico conditional on there already
  being one there or not
* Installer md5sums package to make sure nothing went crazy during
  download.
* Added user_templates to $CONF_DIR.  Upgrades shouldn't clobber
  user created templates, bblog will check for user templates before
  using included templates.
* Categories side box now available through option in bblog.conf

--------------------------------------------------------------------

July 27, 2007 bblog-0.3.6
* No more bug reports.  Posting the tarball to the site for wider 
  consumption.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

July 23, 2007 bblog-0.3.6-RCFinal
* Worked out miscellaneous bugs with the templates and several nasty
  bugs with rebuildlinks()
* Added pingservices() which will ping update services like 
  technorati, blo.gs, etc. upon writing a new article.  Specify
  which services you want to notify by uncommenting them in 
  $CONF_DIR/update_services
* Added pingback() to automagically notify other pingback-enabled
  websites when you're talking about them.
  * No plans on supporting trackbacks due to the fact that the whole
    trackback auto-discovery mechanisim is brain-dead.
* Kevin Foote found a better method to pull RSS_URL in the importRSS
  function.
* Douglas Hunley suggested a commandline switch for rebuildsite(). It
  now shows up under usage and can be called by `bblog -r'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

July 13, 2007 bblog-0.3.6-RC1
* Please allow me to apologize on the slacking of development.  My
  daughter will be 11 months old this month, and between her and
  work, it's all I can do to get anything else done.
	* Stripped all HTML out of bblog script except for the 
	  rebuildlinks() function. (Too many conditionals.  I'm
	  working on it.)
	* Moved from XHTML 1.1 to HTML5 as per WHATWG 
	  recommendations.
	* Templates are now fully user-exposed:
	 	 ~/.bashblogger/templates
	* Kevin P. Foote submitted a Spell Checker function. It
	  can be found under the Article Manager.
	* The Welcome message crap is gone.  Instead, you can now
	  make an article "sticky".  Pick an entry you want to make 
	  "sticky", and it'll stay stuck to the top of the main 
	  page, just like the welcome message used to do.
	* Still working on trackbacks and pinging update services
	  ala Technorati, blogs.us, etc. (should be in RC2).

--------------------------------------------------------------------


October 3, 2006 bblog-0.3.5
* Nick Anderson submitted two bugs
	* When I change the name of an article and rebuild the site
	  the name change only changes in the bash blogger menu. The 
	  index/article etc ... still list the original title.
	  FIXED
	* If you attempt to delete an article and fail to confirm 
	  with Y/n (just press enter) bblog exits instead of 
	  returning to previous menu. FIXED

--------------------------------------------------------------------

September 9, 2006 bblog-0.3.5-RC2
* Nick Anderson submitted a remote synchronization function that 
  seems to work quite well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

August 25, 2006 bblog-0.3.5-RC1
* I would like to have accurate dates reflecting when the following
  changes were made, but, my wife and I are having a baby next month
  and my priorities have been elsewhere.  I pray you all understand.

  New to this release:
  	* User side-boxes
	* RSS2.0 feed (RSS1.0 is now deprecated)
	* Import/Export site via RSS2.0 feed
	* One-stop site rebuild
	* (rudimentary) Podcasting support
	* (rudimentary) template support
	* rough draft support
	* Multiple categories per post
	* Autoformatting is now an option 


--------------------------------------------------------------------

June 20, 2005 bblog-0.3.4.3
* Ben Ritter discovered that editing exisiting pages caused spaces in
  the title to be replaced with underscores.  Mr.Ritter also
  discovered that the built-in autoformatting mangled articles on
  edit.  Autoformatting has been disabled until a safe fix can be
  found.

June 29, 2005 bblog-0.3.4.3
* Matt Sakaluk discovered that head -n0 gives errors on non-GNU
  versions and provided a fix.  Mr. Sakaluk also found that blank
  lines were being prepended to the top or appended to the bottom of
  the master.db if the article being edited was either the first or
  last in the file and also sent in a fix for that as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

April 21, 2005 bblog-0.3.4.2
* Fixed the bblog_setup script to add the path to the CONF_DIR in
  ~/.bblog.conf.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

April 16, 2005 bblog-0.3.4.1
* Made corrections to the CATEGORYARCHIVES & TOPLEVELARCHIVES 
  functions in order to fix a bug for categories with spaces
  in its name.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

April 11, 2005 bblog-0.3.4
* Added Cool URI support that can be turned on or off from the 
  config file

  - articles by category
  - archives by category

  downloadable theme packs

  - Articles
  - Welcome
  - Pages
* Added "breadcrumb navigation" hints

November 11, 2004 bblog-0.3.4
* Added stand-alone page creation tool
* Added central database and reworked most of the functions to use 
  the new .db.  This involved changing the filenames and formats of 
  the files in .entries, again.
* Added flags so that bblog can be used from the command-line,
  e.g bblog -a -t "My new article" -f /home/user/file.txt
  will generate a new article titled "My new article" and the body
  of the article will be taken from the existing file 
  /home/user/file.txt.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

October 10, 2004 bblog-0.3.3

* Problem with non-GNU versions of `ls' fixed from a patch
  submitted by doorsvie.
* Edit and Remove submenus reworked to page through entries from 
  newest to oldest, ten entries at a time.
* Archive and Index generation changed to work on file creation time
  instead of system modification time.  This was accomplished by 
  modifying the filenames of the bits in the .entries directory.

  Existing entries will have to be updated by hand, new entries are
  automatically gnerated in the new format.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

September 26, 2004 bblog-0.3.3

  the permalink function now allowing the user to add, edit and 
  remove entries while the archives update themselves automagically.
* Moved user settings into a central config file (bblog.conf) 
  editable from withing the menu.
* Added a link manager to add, edit, remove and organize the sidebar
  linklist.
* Added a theme switcher to allow simple switching of site layouts 
  from within the menu.  Stylesheets should be edited in the menu
  to prevent Bash Blogger from overwriting changes as the stylsheets
  are considered a part of the theme now.
* New default CSS template.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

June 20, 2004 bblog-0.3.1

* Used some code submitted by Serafeim Zanikolas to implement
  permalinks and an archive hierarchy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

June 20, 2004 bblog-0.3

* Changed dependancy on vi to default to system EDITOR per 
  Jesper R. Meyer

  displaying the contents of the H1 element instead of hiding it in
  CSS capable browsers.

* Removed dependancy on the command-line calculator, bc.
