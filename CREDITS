This is at least a partial credits-file of people that have
contributed to Bash Blogger.  It is formatted in a way that 
allows for easy grepping and beautification by scripts.  
The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address (W), 
PGP key ID and fingerprint (P), description (D)
and snail-mail address (S). 

Thanks,
